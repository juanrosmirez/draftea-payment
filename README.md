# Event-Driven Payment Processing System

A comprehensive, production-ready payment processing system built with Go, implementing modern event-driven architecture patterns for high scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This system implements a sophisticated event-driven payment processing platform that handles digital wallet transactions, external payment gateway integration, and distributed transaction management. The architecture follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with clear bounded contexts and employs advanced patterns including Event Sourcing, CQRS, and Saga orchestration.

```

**Payment Service**: Orchestrates payment workflows, validates requests, and manages payment lifecycle states.

**Wallet Service**: Manages digital wallet operations using Event Sourcing for complete auditability and consistency.

**Gateway Service**: Handles external payment provider integration with circuit breaker patterns for resilience.

**Saga Orchestrator**: Implements distributed transaction management with automatic compensation for failed operations.

**Event Store**: Provides immutable event persistence with snapshot capabilities for performance optimization.

### Payment Flow Architecture

#### Successful Payment Flow
1. **Payment Request** → Validation and saga initialization
2. **Funds Deduction** → Wallet service processes deduction with balance verification
3. **External Processing** → Gateway service communicates with payment provider
4. **Confirmation** → Payment marked as successful, events persisted
5. **Notification** → Downstream services notified via event bus

#### Failure Handling & Compensation
- **Insufficient Funds**: Immediate rejection without external processing
- **Gateway Failures**: Automatic fund reversion using compensation transactions
- **Timeout Scenarios**: Configurable retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Partial Failures**: Saga pattern ensures eventual consistency across services

## 🎯 Technical Design Decisions

### Event Sourcing Implementation
**Decision**: Implemented Event Sourcing for wallet operations to ensure complete auditability and state reconstruction capabilities.

**Justification**: Financial systems require immutable transaction history for regulatory compliance and debugging. Event Sourcing provides:
- Complete audit trail of all state changes
- Ability to reconstruct wallet state at any point in time
- Natural support for temporal queries and analytics
- Enhanced debugging capabilities through event replay

### CQRS Pattern Adoption
**Decision**: Separated command and query responsibilities with dedicated read models.

**Justification**: 
- Optimized read performance through specialized projections
- Independent scaling of read and write operations
- Simplified complex query scenarios
- Enhanced security through command/query separation

### Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions
**Decision**: Implemented choreography-based saga pattern for managing distributed transactions.

**Justification**:
- Maintains data consistency across service boundaries
- Provides automatic compensation for failed operations
- Enables complex business workflows with multiple steps
- Supports long-running transactions without locking resources

### Event Bus Architecture
**Decision**: Implemented asynchronous event-driven communication between services.

**Justification**:
- Loose coupling between services enables independent deployment
- Natural support for eventual consistency patterns
- Enhanced system resilience through async processing
- Simplified integration of new services and features

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Decision**: Implemented circuit breaker pattern for external service integration.

**Justification**:
- Prevents cascade failures from external service outages
- Provides graceful degradation under load
- Enables automatic recovery when services become available
- Improves overall system stability and user experience

### Clean Architecture Principles

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)

### Running the Complete System

1. **Start all services:**
   ```bash
   # With Make (Linux/Mac)
   make up
   
   # Without Make (Windows/Direct)
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Verify services are running:**
   ```bash
   # With Make (Linux/Mac)
   make logs
   
   # Without Make (Windows/Direct)
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

3. **Access the services:**
   - **Payment API**: http://localhost:8080
   - **Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/health
   - **Metrics**: http://localhost:9091/metrics
   - **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
   - **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin123)

4. **Test the API:**
   ```bash
   # Create a payment
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/payments \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "user_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
       "amount": 10000,
       "currency": "USD",
       "description": "Test payment"
     }'
   ```

5. **Stop all services:**
   ```bash
   # With Make (Linux/Mac)
   make down
   
   # Without Make (Windows/Direct)
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Development Mode

For development with hot reload:
```bash
# Start only dependencies
make dev
# This starts PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. and runs the Go app locally
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage
```
**Decision**: Structured codebase following Clean Architecture and SOLID principles.

**Implementation**:
- **Dependency Inversion**: Interfaces define contracts, implementations are injected
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a focused, well-defined purpose
- **Open/Closed**: System extensible without modifying existing code
- **Interface Segregation**: Minimal, focused interfaces for each component
- **Liskov Substitution**: Implementations are fully interchangeable
